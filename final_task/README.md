Parallel Number-theoretic transform
===================================

In this task we are trying to implement a Number-theoretic transform which is a generalization
of a [Fast Fourier Transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform).


## The problem.

Suppose that you need to compute the convolution between two polynomials and you are sure the result could not be greater
than (a * b * c).
