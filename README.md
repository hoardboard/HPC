### Final task :

This taks aims to use CUDA in a distributed system. We are trying to use different GPUS on the same node, and different nodes connected to each other.

For this taks we used a [Number Theoretic Transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform_%28general%29#Number-theoretic_transform) as example.

You can see the code [here](https://github.com/pin3da/HPC/tree/master/final_task)
