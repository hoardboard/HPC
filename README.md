### [Final task :](https://github.com/pin3da/HPC/tree/master/final_task)

This taks aims to use CUDA in a distributed system. We are trying to use different GPUS on the same node, and different nodes connected to each other.

This is a very interesting example because we used CUDA + ZMQ and it works pretty well.

For this task we used a [Number Theoretic Transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform_%28general%29#Number-theoretic_transform) as example.

You can see the code [here](https://github.com/pin3da/HPC/tree/master/final_task)
